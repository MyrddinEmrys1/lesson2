				William Shakespeare  – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of around 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

				Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.

				Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.

				Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time". In the 20th and 21st centuries, his work has been repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.

			<h2> Sonnets: </h2>
			<div>
					From fairest creatures we desire increase, <br>
					That thereby beauty's rose might never die, <br>
					But as the riper should by time decease, <br>
					His tender heir might bear his memory: <br>
					But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, <br>
					Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, <br>
					Making a famine where abundance lies, <br>
					Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. <br>
					Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament <br>
					And only herald to the gaudy spring, <br>
					Within thine own bud buriest thy content, <br>
					And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding: <br>
					Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br>
					To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<br>
			</div>
			
			<div>
					When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, <br>
					And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, <br>
					Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now <br>
					Will be a tottered weed of small worth held: <br>
					Then being asked where all thy beauty lies, <br>
					Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, <br>
					To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes <br>
					Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. <br>
					How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, <br>
					If thou couldst answer, 'This fair child" of mine <br>
					Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse', <br>
					Proving his beauty by succession thine. <br>
					This were to be new made when thou art old, <br>
					And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it<br>
			</div>
			
			<div>
					Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, <br>
					Now is the time that face should form another, <br>
					Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, <br>
					Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
					For where is she so fair whose uneared womb <br>
					Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? <br>
					Or who is he so fond will be the tomb <br>
					Of his self-love to stop posterity? <br>
					Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee <br>
					Calls back the lovely April of her prime; <br>
					So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, <br>
					Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time. <br>
					But if thou live rememb'red not to be, <br>
					Die single, and thine image dies with thee.<br>
			</div>
			
			<div>
					For shame deny that thou bear-st love to any, <br>
					Who for thyself art so improvident. <br>
					Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, <br>
					But that thou none lov'st is most evident; <br>
					For thou art so possess'd with murd'rous hate, <br>
					That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire, <br>
					Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate <br>
					Which to repair should be thy chief desire: <br>
					О change thy thought, that I may change my mind! <br>
					Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? <br>
					Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind, <br>
					Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: <br>
					Make thee another self, for love of me, <br>
					That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br>
			</div>
			
			<div>
					О that you were your self! but, love, you are <br>
					No longer yours than you yourself here live; <br>
					Against this coming end you should prepare, <br>
					And your sweet semblance to some other give: <br>
					So should that beauty which you hold in lease <br>
					Find no determination; then you were <br>
					Your self again after yourself s decease, <br>
					When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. <br>
					Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, <br>
					Which husbandry in honour might uphold <br>
					Against the stormy gusts of winter's day <br>
					And barren rage of death's eternal cold? <br>
					O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know <br>
					You had a father, let your son say so.<br>
			</div>
			
			<div>
					Full many a glorious morning have I seen <br>
					Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, <br>
					Kissing with golden face the meadows green, <br>
					Gilding pale streams with heavenly alcumy, <br>
					Anon permit the basest clouds to ride <br>
					With ugly rack on his celestial face, <br>
					And from the forlorn world his visage hide, <br>
					Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: <br>
					Even so my sun one early morn did shine <br>
					With all triumphant splendor on my brow; <br>
					But out alack, he was but one hour mine, <br>
					The region cloud hath masked him from me now. <br>
					Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth: <br>
					Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.<br>
